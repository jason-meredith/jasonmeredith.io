The year is 2052

Humanity is on the brink of collapse, sweltering from the catastrophic impact of global warming

Bruce Wayne - now an old man - having given his wealth away in search of a fix, is running out of time

At night - the only time it's safe to be outside - visits the grave of Alfred, seeking advice but finding only silence

“This is the only way - but at what cost?”

“Am I dooming Gotham by saving humanity?”

Silence

Over the radio, he gives the solemn instruction - “do it”

At Arkham a group of scientists begin the thawing process of the still youthful VICTOR FREEZE

Still at Alfred’s grave - despite the boiling midnight heat - a tired, withered Bruce looks upward

A single snow flake falls ❄️
